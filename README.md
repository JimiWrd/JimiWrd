- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jomm0
- 👀 I’m interested in many things but mostly Muay Thai, fitness, food, reading, and occasionally noodling on my Ukulele!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python and general web dev through App Academy Open v2.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some open source projects in the near future with the idea to further level up my skills.
