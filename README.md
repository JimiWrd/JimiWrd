- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JimiWrd (Jimi)
- ðŸ‘€ In my spare time I train in Muay Thai, hit the gym, go on hikes with my dog, and occasionally play on my guitar or drums!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a Full Stack Software Dev; my core skill set consists of Spring Boot, Java (8-21), and React (NextJS).
- ðŸ”¨ Check out my portfolio website (jimiward.dev) and GitHub projects for some examples of my stack in action! I'm currently building a cloud-native fitness platform targeting neurodivergent athletes, aptly named NeuroFit.
